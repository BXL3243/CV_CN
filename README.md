### RESEARCH & PROJECTS

* **Real-time "Himalaya Gold (herbal medicine)" Detection      (Apr. 2019-Aug. 2019)**
  * Developed a real-time "Himalaya Gold" detection application to release the pressure of children, and give children opportunity to receive education. We used YOLOv3 in PyTorch to train our model with default COCO dataset and costumed real photos captured on Tanggula Pass by ourselves. We also converted our model to CoreML and applied to IOS device to realize real-time object detection using mobile device. The precision of static objects is 71.3%.


* **Fraud Detection of Internet Finance Based on Machine Learning Technology  (Dec. 2018-June 2019)**
  * Finding and managing fraud data of transaction, and using isolation forest to identify the risk (anomaly during the transaction process). we create an optimized behavior risk scoring model referring to China's e-commerce companies and a new risk control flow to measure risk level.
